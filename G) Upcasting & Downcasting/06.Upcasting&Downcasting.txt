UPCASTING:
*Creating the object of subclass and storing it to the reference of super class.
*It is used to achieve generalization
*With the help of upcasting ,we can access only properties of superclass ,not subclass.
*To achieve upcasting , inheritance is necessary.



DOWNCASTING:
*casting back the upcasted reference to sub class.
*It is also known as specialization.
*With the help of downcasting ,we can access both superclass and subclass properties.
*To achieve upcasting we need to achieve upcasting.
*Downcasting is the explicit process.
