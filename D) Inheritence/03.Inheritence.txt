Inheritance:
Acquiring properties from super class to sub class with the help of extends keyword.
*Inheritance is also known as is-a-relationship.
*We can inherit var and methods from one class to another class
*We cannot inherit blocks and constructors


*The class which denotes the properties is known as parent/super/base class.
*The class which acquire the properties is known as child/sub/derived class.


Diff between this and super keyword
This-used to call the global vars present in same class.
Super-used to call the global vars present in super class.


UML(Unified Modeling Language)
      It is a representation of program in a diagrammatic way.


Types of Inheritance:-

1)Single-level-inheritance:
*Having one parent class and one single child class is known as single-level-inheritance.

2)Multi-level-inheritance:
*Combination of super classes and sub classes from top to bottom sequential way is call MLI.

3)Hierarchical inheritance:
*Having only one parent class and having more than one child class inheriting properties is called Hierarchical inheritance.

4)Multiple Inheritance:
*Having two or more parent class and only one child class is called multiple inheritance.
*MI is not possible in java using class ,but possible using interface.

5)Hybrid Inheritance:
*combination of two or more types of inheritance is known as hybrid inheritance.
*Hybrid inheritance is partially possible in java because when we invoke multiple inheritance in hybrid it is not possible using class ,but when we exclude multiple inheritance it is possible.
