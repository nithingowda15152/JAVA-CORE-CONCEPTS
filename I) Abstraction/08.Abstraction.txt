abstract: It is a keyword in java ,since it is a keyword-we should write it in a lowercase.
meaning of abstract :Incomplete/Overview.
We can prefix abstract keyword for class and method.

ABSTRACT METHOD:
*The method without implementation prefixed with abstract keyword and ending with an semicolon is known as abstraction.
*Whenever we write the abstract method ,we should make class compulsory abstract 
     because ,we cannot write abstract method in concrete class


⦁	CONCRETE CLASS: The class without abstract keyword is called concrete class.
⦁	CONCRETE METHOD: The method without abstract keyword is called concrete method.


NOTE: *To access the abstract method we should inherit the abstract property and override the method ,then we can access it.
      *In abstract method there will be no implementation, we should inherit it and then override-then only we can access.

ABSTRACT CLASS:
DEF: The class prefixed with abstract keyword is known as abstract class.
*We cannot create the object of abstract class but we can create the reference of it.
*abstract class can be inherited to concrete class with the help of extends keyword and mandatorily should override it.
*In abstract class we can write everything except object creation.

*All the non static properties we cannot access in abstract class, because we cannot create object in abstract class
    So, We need to inherit properties from super class to sub class with the help of extends keyword, and with the help of super-call ,the parent class constructor will call all the non-static property will be loaded and through the object creation of subclass we can access all non-static property
Because of this constructor is necessary in abstract class.

ABSTRACTION:
Hiding complex implementation details and providing functionality is known as abstraction.
*With the help of abstraction we can hide the implementation of business logic.

Advantage:*Code reusability
          *loose coupling

abstraction can be achieved in two ways
1)using abstract class
2)using interface

INTERFACE:
DEFINATION-A Java interface is a reference type that defines a contract of abstract methods that implementing classes must provide, allowing multiple classes to share common behavior.

*interface is created with the help of interface keyword.
*interface is a non primitive type in java.
*interface is used as a interface between service provider and user program.
*In interface by default all variables will be public static final & methods will be public abstract.
*From java 8, interface allows a non static method with implementation called default method and also static methods.
*From java 9, private methods are allowed in interface.
*In interface, we don't have constructors.
*In interface, we cannot create an instance or create an object of the interface.
*To inherit the properties from interface, use implements keyword.
*Whenever we inherit the properties from interface, we should mandatorily override abstract methods present in the interface.
*To access static vars and method we should make use of interface name.
*To access the abstract method we should override and with the subclass object creation or with the upcasting we can access the abstract method.
*while overriding abstract methods we should always use public access modifier.
*An interface cannot inherit property from class.
*An interface we can inherit property from another interface with the help of extends keyword.
*In interface static blocks are not allowed because the variables by default are public static final.
