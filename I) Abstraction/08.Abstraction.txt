abstract: It is a keyword in java ,since it is a keyword-we should write it in a lowercase.
meaning of abstract :Incomplete/Overview.
We can prefix abstract keyword for class and method.

ABSTRACT METHOD:
*The method without implementation prefixed with abstract keyword and ending with an semicolon is known as abstraction.
*Whenever we write the abstract method ,we should make class compulsory abstract 
     because ,we cannot write abstract method in concrete class


⦁	CONCRETE CLASS: The class without abstract keyword is called concrete class.
⦁	CONCRETE METHOD: The method without abstract keyword is called concrete method.


NOTE: *To access the abstract method we should inherit the abstract property and override the method ,then we can access it.
      *In abstract method there will be no implementation, we should inherit it and then override-then only we can access.

ABSTRACT CLASS:
DEF: The class prefixed with abstract keyword is known as abstract class.
*We cannot create the object of abstract class but we can create the reference of it.
*abstract class can be inherited to concrete class with the help of extends keyword and mandatorily should override it.
*In abstract class we can write everything except object creation.

*All the non static properties we cannot access in abstract class, because we cannot create object in abstract class
    So, We need to inherit properties from super class to sub class with the help of extends keyword, and with the help of super-call ,the parent class constructor will call all the non-static property will be loaded and through the object creation of subclass we can access all non-static property
Because of this constructor is necessary in abstract class.

abstraction can be achieved in two ways
1)using abstract class
2)using interface

Hiding complex implementation details and providing functionality is known as abstraction.
*With the help of abstraction we can hide the implementation of business logic.

Advantage:*Code reusability
          *loose coupling
