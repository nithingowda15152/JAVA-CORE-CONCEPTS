Method Overriding:
Inheriting Non-static/non-final/non-private properties from super class to sub class is known as method Overriding.

Rules:
*To achieve MO ,inheritance is mandatory.
*The method declaration should be same ,that means same method name ,same return type ,same modifier ,same formal arguments.
*The Access modifier can be same or it should have higher visibility.
       I.e, In parent class if there is a default method is present,in child class we can have default,public,protected(higher visibility).


NEED:

1) To Achieve Runtime Polymorphism:
    Overriding allows java to decide which method to call at runtime based on object type,not on reference type.

2) To Provide specific implementation in sub class.

3) To implement interface/abstract class method:
    when class implements an interace or extends the abstract class,it must ovveride the absttract method to provide actual behavior.

4) To improve existing functionality.


NOTE:
*We cannot overrie main method because,main method is static.
*We cannnot override constructors because,we cannot inherit constructors.
