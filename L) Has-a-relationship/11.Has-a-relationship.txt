HAS-A-RELATIONSHIP:
means one class contains another class as a member variable(field).
(or)
one class has a object of another class.

has-a-relationship doesn't have any specific keyword to achieve , its all about object relationship like how one object depends on another object

There are two types 
1) Composition
2) Aggregation

COMPOSITION:
*The contained object cannot exist without the container object.
*If the container object is destroyed ,then contained object is also destroyed.
*Ownership is very strong.
*EXAMPLES:1)Car has a engine.
          2)Boy has a heart.


AGGREGATION:
*he contained object can exist without the container object.
*The container object uses or refers to object created elsewhere.
*Ownership is very weak.
*EXAMPLES:1)library has a book.
          2)company has a employee.


Advantages:
*code reusability
*increase flexibility
*has encapsulated behavior
    EX: Car doesn't need to know how engine works ,but it just want to use it.
