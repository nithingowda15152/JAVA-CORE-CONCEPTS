Constructors

Types:
1)Default constructors
2)Parameterized constructors
3)copy constructors

Constructors(Default & Parameterized):
*Constructors are the group of statement executed each time a object is created.
*It should be same as class name.
*It should not contain any static modifier.
*Return type should not be present.
*Constructors are used to initialize the object.

Constructor Overloading:
*In a class having more than 1 constructor ,but diff arguments is called constructor overloading.

Copy Constructors:
*creating new constructor same as existing constructor with same exact parameters ,then we have to pass the current object(which contain values) as reference to the new object.

call to this statement[this();]
*Its used to call the curreny class constructor from constructor
*SYNTAX->this(args);

Constructor Chaining:
*First achieve constructor overloading.
*constructor can be called from another constructor using 1)call to this(); 2)call to super(); is called constructor chaining.
