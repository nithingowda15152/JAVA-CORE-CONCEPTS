BLOCKS:
Blocks are the set of instructions used for initialization

Types
1)static Blocks
2)Non-static Block

STATIC BLOCK:

*Prefixed with static keyword.
*Used to initialize the static Variables.
*In a class we can create n number of blocks ,but execution starts from top to bottom(Sequentially).
*Also static blocks executes before main method itself(in class loading itself).


NON-STATIC BLOCK:
*Non-static block is not prefixed with any keyword.
*Used to initialize the both static and non static variables.
*To initialize the Variables ,we must and should have to create the object.
*We can create a object inside static block ,but not in non-static block.
