ENCAPSULATION:
The process of grouping and protecting the data members & data function in a single entity called class.

ADVANTAGE:
*With the help of encapsulation validation can be done.(protecting the data or data security)
*The flexibility of data
    The data can be made either write only / read only.
        write only by setters.
        read only by getters.

*Readability of code is improved
The best example for encapsulation is java bean class.

Specification of bean class:
*class must be public non abstract class.
*The class should have public non-parameterized constructor.
*Variable should be declared as private
*Those variables should have respective setter and getter methods.
*The class must implements from marker interface known as serializable.
